# Controlling the Draw Loop #

This week we will cover how to control the way processing.js controls the draw loop.

There are a few functions that processing.js provides us for controlling drawing:

* loop() and noLoop(), which will start and stop the draw loop.
  Use these to play or pause an animation.

* frameRate(), which controls how frequently the draw loop happens.


On Khan Academy, we have provided a semi-complicated animation that uses these functions. This animation illustrates how these methods can be used, along with keyboard integration to provide controls.

Some questions to ask yourself about the code:


1. Are there any problems with the code? What can go wrong? Is there anything a little strange about it?

2. What is the difference between increasing the frequency of the draw loop and the amount that each loop increases the font size?

3. If you wanted to change the code so that the ‘LOL’ also changed color during the animation, how would you do it?
