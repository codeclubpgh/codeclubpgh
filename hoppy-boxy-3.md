# Hoppy Boxy


Part 3: Adding objects to the code and adding walls with holes.

Before we get into checking to see if our hoppy box hits into a wall, 
we need to clean up the code a little bit and add a cleaner level 
generation interface.

Try it out here:

We have started to add examples from previous weeks here:

Goals for this week:

1. Play with it! Does it "work" as a game?

1. Experiment with the code. 
    1. How do the pieces fit together?
    2. How does each piece work?
    2. Does the program make sense to you? 
    3. Is the code clearer than it was before?
    4. Are there any bugs or potential problems? (hint: yes, there are some)
2. Experiment with the variables the control level generation. What can you change?

Ask any questions!
